This is yet another reimplementation of the Dwarf Fortress libgraphics.so build
system. There are two build options available, plain Makefile and autotools,
with the former almost certainly working better on all Linux systems. Select one
with `git checkout makefile' or `git checkout autotools', then run get_df.sh
with no arguments to download DF, or one argument to extract it from a
pre-downloaded archive. Manually extracting Dwarf Fortress is *NOT SUPPORTED*.
Do NOT copy all Dwarf Fortress files on top of this directory.
